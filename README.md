# 2D Java Game Diploma Project

This project is a 2D desktop game developed in Java as a bachelor project.  
The game is built using core Java technologies without external libraries, with a focus on object oriented design, game loops, collision handling, and basic AI behavior.

## Project Overview
The application represents a classic 2D game where the player can:
- move around the map
- interact with NPC characters
- engage in combat with enemies
- navigate through menus
- experience sound effects and background music

The main goal of the project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of Java SE, game architecture, and software design principles.

## Technologies Used
- Java SE
- Java Swing/AWT rendering and UI
- Ant project build tool
- BufferedImage sprite and tile rendering
- Clip(javax.sound.sampled) sound and music
- Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

No external libraries or game engines were used.

## Features
- Main menu (New Game/Quit)
- Tile based map system
- Player movement and collision detection
- NPC interaction and dialog system
- Enemy entities with basic AI behavior
- Combat system
- Sound effects and background music
- Game states(menu, play, pause, game over)

## Project Structure
Main components of the project include:

- `Main` application entry point
- `GamePanel` core game loop and rendering
- `KeyHandler` keyboard input handling
- `UI` menus and in game user interface
- `Sound` audio management
- `GameState` control of game flow and states
- Entity classes(Player, NPCs, Enemies)

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE(IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)
2. Make sure Java JDK is installed
3. Build the project using Ant
4. Run the `Main` class

## Purpose
This project was developed as a **diploma project** to demonstrate:
- understanding of Java fundamentals
- object-oriented programming skills
- basic game architecture
- ability to design and implement a complete software application

## Notes
This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
